P2 : Design a url shortner

* Given a long URL, the service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it.

* When the user hits a short link, the service should redirect to the original link.

* Links will expire after a standard default time span.

* The system should be highly available. This is really important to consider because if the service goes down, all the URL redirection   will start failing.

* URL redirection should happen in real-time with minimal latency.

* Shortened links should not be predictable.

* Short URL length can be up to 30 characters starting from prefix: www.habuild.in/


Assuming, we will have 5M new URL shortenings per month, with 100:1 read/write ratio
